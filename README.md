## 👩‍💻 My Contribution
This project was built independently over 2 months as part of my learning journey. I:
- Imported, cleaned, and shaped the dataset in Power BI
- Created multiple DAX measures and calculated columns
- Designed and structured the dashboard layout
- Applied logic to highlight insights over decades

*AI tools were used only to guide and improve my logic framing — all implementation and visualization work was done by me.*
